# Web Development Material

Welcome to the Web Development Material repository! This repository is a collection of resources and learning materials that cover the fundamentals of web development. Whether you're new to web development or looking to expand your skills, you'll find something useful here.

The repository is organized into three directories: 
- `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. Each directory contains resources that will help you learn and practice the core concepts of that language. 

- In the `HTML` directory, the `first.html` file contains all the learning materials for HTML. 

- In the `CSS` directory, each topic is explained in a separate folder to make it easy to find what you're looking for. And `notes.txt` is basically summarizing all the topics 

- In the `JavaScript` directory, you can refer `notes.txt` and other than that each file contains comments to help you understand the code.

We welcome contributions to this repository. If you have any suggestions, feel free to submit a pull request.

I hope you find this repository helpful in your web development journey! Happy coding!
